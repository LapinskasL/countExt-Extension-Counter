# countExt-Extension-Counter

This is a Windows Command Line script that displays the number of files in a directory with a user-defined extension. 

To use it, open CMD in the same folder as the batch file and write **countExt** _directory_path_ and press enter. Then, type the desired extension to search for and press enter.

This extension was an assignment for a college course.
